			<h3>Components <small>and their usage</small></h3>
			<p>In Bootstrap, a component may be used regardless of the other components and its default style is already defined inside the main Bootstrap CSS (though a few may also require JavaScript). Thus, you can generate as many different instances of a component as per your requirements with the same visual style applied to them and saving yourself precious time and effort, thereby allowing you to focus on the more vital parts of your development process.</p>
			<p class="lead">Lead paragraph example. Bootstrap defines a lead paragraph as a paragraph that stands out from others. It does so by increasing its bottom margin and font size and decreasing its font weight and line height.</p>
