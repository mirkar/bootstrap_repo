			<p>You can create rows and columns on the page using the row and column CSS classes. You have to use rows to create a horizontal group of columns, and only columns can be immediate children of rows. Usually, you can use the .col-md- Grid classes to develop a system that is displayed as stacked in small devices; they turn horizontal on the desktop and large screens. The col class should be used in conjunction with the .col-md-X class (where X is the grid unit width that the block element should have) to add a width to the columns. The total number of columns in a row should not be greater than 12, which is the default for the maximum number of columns in a single row on desktops and large screens.</p>

			<p>As already mentioned, columns will be displayed one after the other on a small screen. Suppose that you want a column-based format for small devices as well. In such a scenario, you have to include the col-sm-X CSS class in the code.</p>
